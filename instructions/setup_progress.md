### SvelteKit Project Setup
- Created a new SvelteKit project with TypeScript support
- The project structure includes standard SvelteKit directories:
  - `src/` for application code
  - `static/` for static assets
  - `.svelte-kit/` for build artifacts

### UI Setup
- Set up shadcn-svelte for UI components
- Added Tailwind CSS configuration in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Configured with the shadcn-svelte theming system including:
  - Color scheme variables using HSL format
  - Custom border radius values based on a common radius variable
  - Custom animations for components like accordions
  - Sidebar-specific theme variables

## Core UI Framework Implementation (2025-03-29)

### TinyBase State Management
- Implemented TinyBase for state management
- Created store structure in `src/lib/stores/recipeStore.ts`:
  - `wizardState` table for tracking current step and completed steps
  - `recipePreferences` table for storing user selections
- Added helper functions for state manipulation:
  - `updateStep()` - Updates the current step
  - `markStepComplete()` - Marks a step as completed
  - `getCompletedSteps()` - Retrieves completed steps
  - `getCurrentStep()` - Gets the current active step
- Implemented IndexedDB persistence in the layout component for persistent state across page refreshes

### Wizard Navigation System
- Created a file-based routing structure for the wizard steps:
  - `/skill` - Skill level selection
  - `/cuisine` - Cuisine type selection
  - `/dietary` - Dietary preferences selection
- Implemented route protection to prevent users from skipping steps
- Added navigation controls (Next/Back buttons) with proper state updates

### Step Progress Component

- Added visual indicators for:
  - Completed steps (filled circles with primary color)
  - Current step (outlined circle with primary color)
  - Upcoming steps (muted color)
  - Progress lines between steps

### Wizard Interface Components
- Implemented skill level selection with radio button UI
- Created cuisine selection with a grid of cuisine options
- Built dietary preferences selection with checkbox UI
- Added a summary view on the home page after completing all steps

### Next Steps
1. Develop the recipe generation functionality:
   - Create the recipe service to generate personalized recipes
   - Implement the recipe display components
   - Add loading states and error handling

2. Enhance the user experience:
   - Add animations for transitions between steps
   - Implement form validation
   - Create a more detailed recipe results page
